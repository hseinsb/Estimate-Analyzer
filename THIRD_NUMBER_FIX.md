# 🔧 **Fixed Cost Extraction - Now Capturing 3rd Number (Cost Column)**

## ✅ **Problem Identified:**

### **Issue:**
CCC One estimates have **3 columns** for labor, paint supplies, and sales tax:
1. **Hours** (1st number)
2. **Hourly Rate** (2nd number) 
3. **Cost** (3rd number) ← **This is what we need**

### **Previous Problem:**
- Parser was capturing the **1st number** (Hours) instead of **3rd number** (Cost)
- This gave us hours like "8.0" instead of cost like "800.00"

## 🔧 **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Updated Regex Patterns to Capture 3rd Number:**
```typescript
// Before (capturing 1st number - Hours):
/Body\s*Labor\s*\$?([\d,]+\.?\d*)/i

// After (capturing 3rd number - Cost):
/Body\s*Labor\s*[\d,]+\.?\d*\s*[\d,]+\.?\d*\s*\$?([\d,]+\.?\d*)/i
```

### **2. Pattern Breakdown:**
- `Body\s*Labor` - Match the label
- `[\d,]+\.?\d*` - Skip 1st number (Hours)
- `\s*` - Allow whitespace
- `[\d,]+\.?\d*` - Skip 2nd number (Hourly Rate)
- `\s*` - Allow whitespace
- `\$?([\d,]+\.?\d*)` - **Capture 3rd number (Cost)**

### **3. Applied to All Affected Fields:**
- ✅ **Body Labor**: Now captures 3rd number (Cost)
- ✅ **Paint Labor**: Now captures 3rd number (Cost)
- ✅ **Mechanical Labor**: Now captures 3rd number (Cost)
- ✅ **Frame Labor**: Now captures 3rd number (Cost)
- ✅ **Paint Supplies**: Now captures 3rd number (Cost)
- ✅ **Sales Tax**: Now captures 3rd number (Cost)

## 🎯 **CCC One Table Structure:**
```
Category          Hours    Hourly Rate    Cost
Body Labor        8.0      50.00          800.00  ← 3rd number
Paint Labor       4.0      50.00          400.00  ← 3rd number
Paint Supplies    1.0      200.00         200.00  ← 3rd number
Sales Tax         0.0      0.00           244.00  ← 3rd number
```

## 🧪 **Test the Fix:**

### **Expected Console Output:**
```
🔍 Found Body Labor Cost (3rd number): 800.00  (was 8.0 before)
🔍 Found Paint Labor Cost (3rd number): 400.00 (was 4.0 before)
🔍 Found Paint Supplies Cost (3rd number): 200.00 (was 1.0 before)
🔍 Found Sales Tax Cost (3rd number): 244.00 (was 0.0 before)
```

### **What's Working Correctly (Don't Touch):**
- ✅ **Parts**: Already extracting cost correctly (single column)
- ✅ **Miscellaneous**: Already extracting cost correctly (single column)
- ✅ **Other Charges**: Already extracting cost correctly (single column)
- ✅ **Subtotal**: Already extracting cost correctly (single column)
- ✅ **Grand Total**: Already extracting cost correctly (single column)
- ✅ **Insurance Pay**: Already extracting cost correctly (single column)

## ✅ **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Accurate cost extraction** for all labor types
- ✅ **Correct paint supplies cost** instead of hours
- ✅ **Proper sales tax amount** instead of rate
- ✅ **Maintains existing working fields** (Parts, Misc, etc.)

**The parser now correctly extracts the 3rd number (Cost column) for labor, paint supplies, and sales tax!** 🎯
